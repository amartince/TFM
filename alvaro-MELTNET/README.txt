This code has been done for my master's thesis. It rebuilts the NN proposed by Rosier,
please check its repository (https://zenodo.org/records/7018247).

The folder named "TFM" contains the Manifest.toml and Project.toml of the enviroment.

There are two approaches done, the original Rosier code (MELTNET) and a simplied version
proposed by Jan Swierczek-Jereczek (MELTNET_Jan_aproach),
